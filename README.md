#🐰 Jumping Rabbit – OOP Project
Jumping Rabbit is a 2D platformer game developed as a group project for our Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) course. The game was built collaboratively by our team, applying OOP principles throughout the development process.

Inspired by a simple online game we stumbled upon, we recreated and expanded it with custom enhancements, including:

🎮 Core gameplay mechanics

📋 A functional and interactive menu system

🔊 Integrated audio effects and background music

This project showcases our ability to work as a team, apply object-oriented design patterns, and implement engaging features beyond basic gameplay.
