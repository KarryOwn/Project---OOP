# Project---OOP
Jumping Rabbit is a product of our group project for the Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) course. We worked together to complete it as a team. Inspired by a game we randomly discovered on the internet, we developed the core gameplay mechanics and expanded it further by implementing a custom menu system and audio features.
Below is an image of the Jumping Rabbit game:
